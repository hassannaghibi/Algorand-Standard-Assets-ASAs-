# Algorand-Standard-Assets-ASAs with third party API services (Pyhon)
Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs)

The Algorand protocol supports the creation of on-chain assets that benefit from the same security, compatibility, speed and ease of use as the Algo. The official name for assets on Algorand is Algorand Standard Assets (ASA).

With Algorand Standard Assets you can represent stablecoins, loyalty points, system credits, and in-game points, just to name a few examples. You can also represent single, unique assets like a deed for a house, collectable items, unique parts on a supply chain, etc. There is also optional functionality to place transfer restrictions on an asset that help support securities, compliance, and certification use cases.

Use third-party API services to access native Algorand REST APIs for the mainnet, testnet, and betanet. This is an excellent choice if you don't want to set up a local network using Docker, and just want to experiment with Algorand development initially. Existing service providers are Purestake and Rand Labs. Bear in mind that the free tiers for both service providers come with certain limitations, like the number of requests per second (more information on both websites). You can access these services via an API key and Algorand node address.
